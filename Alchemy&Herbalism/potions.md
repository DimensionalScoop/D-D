# Brewing Potions

The art of finding, preserving, storing, chopping, soaking and finally brewing herbs and components to create potions is an old craft, reaching back to the very first sentient creatures that walked the natural world.  
As an aspiring druid and guild artisan you combine the natural expertise and the fine skills needed to craft potions many could only dream of.

## Procuring for Ingredients

### Plants and Herbs
Searching for rare plants and herbs requires one hour of free time and an natural environment featuring plants. For every hour you spend procuring, you roll a d4 on the *Procuring Circumstances Table* and d4 + d6 + d8 on the *Ingredient Effects and Rarity Table*. Add the modifiers from the *Procuring Modifiers Table* to the result of your d4 roll to see how many components can be found. Therefore a possible double dice or triple dice roll from the d4 +d6 +d8 roll has to be taken into consideration.
The *Ingredient Effects and Rarity Table* shows the different components you are able to find - in case you have not rolled a triple dice you find the herb(s) indicated by the result of your d4 + d6 +d8 roll.
You decide which version, A or B, to use. Note that this choice is permanent for the region you are in.
In addition you are always able to find some common herbs. Choose herbs from the *Common Herbs Table* totalling 5 +/- twice the according environment modifier from the *Procuring Modifiers Table*.

### Poisons from Creatures
You can attempt to harvest ingredients from a poisonous creature like a snake or wyvern. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 18 Intelligence (Nature) check to harvest enough material for a single vial. Should you fail this check you are unable to extract any poison. If you fail this check by 5 or more, you rupture the creature's glands and are subject to the poison's effects. The poison extracted from a shapeshifted creature vanishes when the creature re-assumes its true form.  
The minimum difficulty modifier to turn the extracted poison into a usable potion is +5, with the actual modifier determined by the DM at the time of crafting.  
A poison can also be extracted from a creature contracting a highly contagious disease. An additional DC 10 Constitution saving throw must be made when harvesting such a creature. On a failed save you contract the disease.

## The brewing process
Only characters proficient in alchemy can attempt brewing. Without a proficiency you need a recipe or counseling and don't add your proficiency bonus when brewing.

### Equipment
Brewing potions requires *Alchemist's supplies* and a cauldron supplied by heat source. Use the *Heat Source Table* to figure out what source to use. Unless stated otherwise, a gallon of water, wyrmtongue and a vial to hold the potion is needed for each potion. Potions with a Craft DC below 11 can be crafted in the field during a short rest. Otherwise, a safe workshop environment like a lab or a room at an inn is required.

##### Heat Source
| Source | DC modifier |
|:----|:-------------|
| Wood, just collected  | -2 |
| Dried Wood  | -1 |
| Coal| +1 |
| Charcoal | +2 |
| Elusum | Advantage |
| Lava | Advantage |
| Unsheltered | -2 |

### Mixing ingredients
All ingredients can be matched and mixed to achieve the desired effects. Add the DCs of the components used to calculate the Craft DC. Mixing potions post-brewing is subject to the *Mixing Potions* Rule (DMG p.140).  
After spending (Craft DC)/10 hours to brew the potion, make an Intelligence and a Wisdom Check (add your proficiency bonus to both) and use the average result against the Craft DC. On a successful check you create one vial of the potion. On a failure, all ingredients are lost. On a failure by 5 or more, roll on the *Brewing Mishap Table*. Should you roll a 20 on the d20 used to make the check, you are able to stretch the ingredients and make 2 vials.

```
```
##### Brewing Mishap
| d6 | Effect |
|:-|:-------------|
|1|A plume of smoke rises from the cauldron. All creatures next to the cauldron take 3d6 fire damage and are blinded until the end of their next turn.|
|2|The potion burns through the cauldron like acid, destroying the cauldron and extinguishing the hearth.
|3|The potion is brewed successfully, but disappears from the cauldron and re-appears after 1d6 hours in a location determined by the DM.
|4|The potion seems to function as normal. Roll a d4 when using the potion. On a 1, the potion has no effect. On a 2-3 the potion affects any creature in the vicinity of the user, but not the user. On a 4 the bottle holding the potion explodes 1d20 hours after brewing, ripping the bottle's container and releasing the potion.
|5| The brewer suffers from all effects of the potion as if imbued.
|6| The cauldron vanishes with a loud roar into the sky, showing little concern for upper floors or rooftops.




### Shelf Life
Potions made using Wyrmtounge are stable for 3d4 days, after which they start to break down and decay. Potions with the stable property retain their effects for one year or longer.


## Using Potions
Drinking a vial of potion uses an action; the potion's effect occurs immediately unless otherwise stated. If a potion contains *Bloodroot* it can be applied to a sharp weapon or up to three projectiles using an action. The potion on a sharp weapon remains effective for 3 blows and dries after 3 minutes.  
A poison containing *Verbrennnessel* can be applied to any surface up to one square meter in size and remains effective for 1d4*3 hours after which it dries.
